# Integrated Personal & Business Operations UI Design

This document translates the conceptual UI outline into a concrete product plan. It focuses on creating a modular web-based control center that unifies personal goals, business KPIs, financial management, and security compliance tooling.

## 1. Global Design Principles

* **Single Source of Truth**: Every component reads from a shared data layer to keep all widgets synchronized.
* **Modular Layout**: Use a responsive, card-based grid with drag-and-drop ordering. Each card exposes a consistent header area (title, quick filters, context actions) and a content area.
* **Data Integration**: Support ingestion pipelines for spreadsheets, QuickBooks, Clay.com, Google Workspace, and internal automation tools (n8n, Groq-based agents).
* **Color Language**: Neutral background, with positive metrics in teal/green, warning states in amber, and critical states in red. Business ventures get badge colors (e.g., RF/SDR = deep blue, Cold Calling = burnt orange).
* **Navigation**: Persistent left sidebar with icons + labels for the ten primary sections. Top bar includes global search, quick-add button (task, call log, transaction), notifications, and profile/security menu.

## 2. Dashboard (Home)

| Widget | Purpose | Key Data Points | Interactions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sovereignty Score Dial | Composite index summarizing financial health, business growth, debt reduction. | Score value, percentile change, trend sparkline. | Tap to open scoring methodology modal and drill into contributing metrics. |
| Business Health Snapshot | Quick glance of active ventures. | Venture name, status badge, lead revenue KPI, pipeline velocity. | Filter by venture, drill into venture workspace. |
| Personal Progress Ring | Visualizes completion of top personal objectives. | Goal name, progress %, ETA to completion. | Add/update goal tasks, mark milestones complete. |
| Capital & Liquidity Card | Shows total liquid capital vs target reserves. | Cash on hand, emergency fund status, runway. | Expand to see accounts and transfer shortcuts. |
| Debt Tracker Heatmap | Highlights liabilities. | Debt type, balance, payoff date, payment status. | Schedule payments, adjust payoff plans. |
| Income Streams Bar Chart | Compare income channels. | W-2, subscriptions, micro-brands, consulting. | Toggle timeframe, open detailed income analysis. |
| Task Snapshot | Consolidates upcoming tasks. | Due date, owner, linked project. | Quick complete/postpone, open task detail. |
| Calendar Peek | Display next 7 days of events. | Event name, type (personal/business), location. | Jump to Calendar section. |

## 4. Financial Management

* **Accounts Overview Page**: Stacked list of accounts (bank, brokerage, crypto wallets) with balances and trend sparklines.

* **Revenue Projection Widget**: Adjustable sliders for connect rate and conversion to see MRR forecast, ties to overall business KPIs.
* **QA & Coaching Panel**: Annotated call reviews, auto-generated AI insights, coach assignment tracker.

## 6. Life Engine Tracker

* **Venture Scorecards**: Each venture card shows mission statement, key KPIs, recent wins, blockers, and action items.
* **Capital & Debt Logs**: Table summarizing capital deployments, outstanding obligations, ROI, linked tasks to adjust capital allocation.
* **Action Matrix**: Eisenhower-style grid prioritizing tasks by impact vs urgency. Supports batch updates and delegations.
* **Cross-Venture Dependencies**: Graph view mapping relationships between tasks across ventures (e.g., hardware installation dependencies).

## 7. Business Infrastructure

* **Infrastructure Inventory**: Tabbed view for Hardware, Software, Cloud, Automation. Each item displays owner, status, maintenance schedule.
* **Monitoring Integrations**: Embed Grafana/Prometheus panels for uptime, server load, network usage.
* **Automation Tracker**: List of n8n flows, Groq agents, cron jobs with status badges, last run, next run, and error rate.
* **Deployment Timeline**: Chronological log of deployments (e.g., Coolify, Docker Compose). Supports rollback note attachments.

## 8. Security & SOP Compliance

* **Incident Logbook**: Table of incidents with severity, resolution, post-mortem link.
* **Access Review Dashboard**: Matrix of users vs systems showing privilege level, MFA status, and review dates.
* **Alert Center**: Integration with security tooling to surface critical alerts, with runbook links.

## 9. Personal Life & Household

* **Household Harmony Board**: Track household projects, behavioral interventions, and value realization metrics.
* **IoT Insights**: Tiles for motion sensors, cameras, smart appliances. Shows anomaly detection and predictive suggestions.

## 12. Technical Architecture Recommendations

* **Frontend**: React (Next.js) with TypeScript, component library (e.g., Chakra UI) for consistent theming. Use Zustand or Redux Toolkit for state management.
* **Backend**: GraphQL or REST API via NestJS / FastAPI. Integrate with PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series metrics.
* **Data Pipelines**: Use Airbyte/Fivetran for third-party integrations, store raw data in data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake or Postgres schemas).
* **Analytics Layer**: dbt models to transform raw data into KPI-ready tables. Connect to Superset/Metabase for advanced analytics.
* **Automation Hooks**: Webhook listeners for n8n, Slack bots for notifications, integration with Groq for AI summarization.
* **Security**: OAuth2 for authentication, row-level security on sensitive tables, secrets managed in Vault.

## 13. Implementation Roadmap

1. **Discovery & Data Audit**: Inventory existing data sources, SOPs, and current tooling.
2. **Design Sprint**: Wireframe key dashboards, validate layout with stakeholders.
3. **MVP Build**:
